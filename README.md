## Generations and their purposes
* Gen1 - Old Crypto Functions Solution
* Gen1_1 - New Crypto Function Solution
* Gen2 - Password Generation Tool for personal use.

### Requirements
Just a GUI web browser
* Runs completely on web browser, no need of additional libraries. 
* Runs locally on webbrowsers no need of internet. 


### DominoPasswordGen2 For personal use
* Set the pin from 1 thru 99999 , takes about 10secs for 99999. 
* Then click and generate random seed string.

### IDEA is...
Use different pins, but remember the pattern and the sequence in which the domino pattern is created. 
* Then change the pins for creating secure passwords for various applications and websites. 
* or, You could keep the pin constant and change the domino pattern for various applications and websites. 
* or, You could change the pin and domino pattern for every for various applications and websites. 


### Changes
* Gen1   - For Crypto functions (old algo), same as index.html. 
* Gen1_1 - For Crypto functions with updated shuffle algorithm. 
* Gen2   - For Password generation only, not for crypto functions. 


### Common Usage Steps: 
1. Set the Pin number. Should be from 1 to 99999 (including). 
2. Generate Random String. 
3. Setup the domino pattern. 
4. Remember the pin and the pattern. 
5. Either pattern or pin can remain constant, the password will change accordingly. 
6. Use different pin and same pattern or same pin and different pattern on websites. 


### NOTE: 
Please use caution. 
Use new MAJOR version number if the algorithm is changed and copy and create a new html file.
