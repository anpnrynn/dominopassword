Gen1 - Old Crypto Functions Solution
Gen1_1 - New Crypto Function Solution
Gen2 - Password Generation Tool for personal use.

GEN 2 For personal use
Set the pin from 1 thru 99999 , takes about 10secs for 99999. 
Then click and generate random seed string. 
Create a Domino pattern, in pattern1 (should suffice for most cases), pattern2 (for larger passwords), and pattern3 for (really large passwords). 
The password should be seen in the final text box below Domino Password Pattern. 

IDEA is...
Use different pins, but remember the pattern and the sequence in which the domino pattern is created. 
 
Then change the pins for creating secure passwords for various applications and websites. 
or, 
You could keep the pin constant and change the domino pattern for various applications and websites. 
or 
You could change the pin and domino pattern for every for various applications and websites. 




Use new MAJOR version number if the algorithm is changed and copy and create a new html file.
